# Improvement on Global Wheat Head Detection Model by Assessing Different Image Metadata Specific Domains 

Improving domain generalization by domain exploration and relabeling
Domain Shift - 
Machine-learning models perform poorly when deployed on test data with a different data distribution than the training data
Domain Generalization - 
The task of learning from multiple source domains a model that generalizes well to unseen domains.
Improve Domain generalization - 
Re-label to get “better aligned” domains and map source domain images to the new domain labels.
